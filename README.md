# BizCase 02 - Netflix-Data-Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib

# Business Problem:
Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform. The dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries

# Business Case Study Highlights:
- Data cleaning: Dealing with list values/nested string values in the dataset
    - For example, A particular movie can belong to multiple Genres (like Drama, Comedy)
    - In such cases, the data were presented as follows: Dramas, Comedy
    - We have used Python string functions and pandas effectively to handle such data
- We have performed extensive EDA to address the business problem.
    - Throughout the notebook, we have frequently plotted a lot of graphs and used methods like pd.melt, pd.pivot, pd.pivot_table to restructure the       data in order to get the desired information
    - We have performed the EDA on movies and tv-shows separately and finally compared the two together
